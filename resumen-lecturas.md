# HBR creating a culture of quality

many of the traditional strategies used to increase quality—monetary
incentives, training, and sharing of best practices, for instance—have little effect. Instead, we found,
companies that take a grassroots, peer-driven approach develop a culture of quality,


We pinpointed four factors that drive quality as a cultural value: leadership emphasis, message
credibility, peer involvement, and employee ownership of quality issues.

## Maintaining a leadership emphasis on quality

Seagate, a $14 billion provider of media storage solutions, uses a series of leadership engagement
mechanisms to help executives identify inconsistencies between their actions or decisions and the
company’s ideal culture. Company leaders begin by agreeing on what would constitute an ideal
culture and what behaviors would be needed to achieve it. Next, the quality and HR teams
compared their definitions of “ideal culture” with employees’ observations, which revealed areas for
improvement. The leaders then attended workshops that helped them spot behaviors that might be
impeding their stated goal. Simulations made the lessons from the workshop concrete and
memorable.

## Ensuring message Credibility

Diageo identified four distinct segments of employees in terms of what drives hard work and created
quality messages tailored to each one. It recognized that some workers respond best to messages
emphasizing the reduced cost and hassle of producing defect-free goods, for example, while others
are inspired by an emphasis on customer satisfaction. Local site managers chose the campaign they
thought would most appeal at their site, and this customization helped the company’s messages
resonate.

## Encouraging peer involvement

One organization that has created effective peer networks is HGST (formerly Hitachi Global Storage
Technologies), a Western Digital company. It uses positive social pressure to encourage employees to
generate quality initiatives. The company displays employees’ ideas on posters in a busy hallway,
providing a reminder that everyone at the company should work on quality. Managers publicly
evaluate employees’ quality-improvement projects, highlighting not only business impact but also
softer criteria, such as participant enthusiasm. HGST also organizes friendly “quality competitions”
that capitalize on collective pride, not simply financial rewards, to spark ideas.

### Increasing employee ownership and empowerment.
One of the defining traits of an organization with a true culture of quality is that employees are free
to apply judgment to situations that fall outside the rules. Providing the right level of guidance is
key. Too much stifles creativity and discretionary action, while too little leaves employees unclear
about their authority to make decisions and carry them out.

# INFOQ Creating a Culture of Quality

Culture manifests itself through an organization’s values, norms, beliefs, and habits – and
these, in turn, impact product quality by guiding team actions. I’m not talking about what an
organization says it does; I’m talking about what it actually does - at all levels.


It can be quite instructive to observe
how a team decides whether quality is good enough to release – since this is perhaps the
most important single decision impacting quality that is made during a release.

- Leadership emphasis: métricas
- Message credibility: Successful managers carefully choose the right way to communicate the quality message based on what resonates with their team.
- Peer involvement:
  - Create rituals at design time.
  - Invite peer assessments.
  - Encourage pair programming.
- Employee ownership & empowerment.
  - Recognize quality initiatives. Create individual measures of quality  and provide visibility and recognition to those on your team who get results.
  - Create competitions. For a big project, consider awarding prizes to the top performers who implement the highest-quality code.
  - Construct learning opportunities.

In my 15 years of engineering and product management experience at small and mid-size
software companies, I have found that the 2 most powerful approaches to influencing culture
are creating rituals and recognizing achievements. Rituals have the capacity to powerfully
align teams behind a common practice (forging a team identity), and rewarding successful
initiatives create incentives for team members to feel a sense of ownership over their
decisions and focus on what matters most.
